### **Loredoria: The Last Bastion**  

In the ancient land of **Loredoria**, the veil between realms is thinning. For centuries, the noble Houses of the High Lords defended the great cities, their wisdom carved into the very stone of their towering fortresses. Magic, once bound to the earth itself, now seeps into the air like a living force, awakening both the righteous and the wicked.   

But the balance has shattered.   

From the Abyssal Rift, the **Vorlokk**, an army of eldritch horrors and war-cursed knights, march forth, their only purpose: the total subjugation of Loredoria. Their leader, the Shadow Regent **Mazrith Korr**, an exiled High Lord consumed by forbidden knowledge, wields an artifact of unfathomable power—the **Crown of Sundering**—which allows him to tear through reality itself.  

The High Lords, scattered and divided, have summoned the **Ardent Wardens**, an ancient order of tacticians, warriors, and spell-forgers. You, a newly appointed **Warden of the Last Bastion**, must rally the remaining defenders and fortify the **Seven Bastions**—the last strongholds of free Loredoria. Each Bastion houses an **Aether Beacon**, artifacts that can mend the rift if properly protected.  

### **Gameplay & Vibes**
- **Tower Defense, Reforged** – Place **Runed Towers**, imbue them with elemental forces, and unleash devastating **Ward Sigils** to hold the line.  
- **Legendary Lords & Champions** – Recruit High Lords and wandering heroes, each with unique abilities and dynamic interactions.  
- **Deep Strategy & Terrain** – Fortresses sit atop ancient ley lines, and positioning affects the strength of both defense and enemy corruption.  
- **The Great Sundering** – The longer you play, the more reality fractures. New enemy types emerge, and time-warped versions of past battles may return to haunt you.  

### **Aesthetic & Tone**  
- **LOTR meets Dark Fantasy** – Think Elden Ring meets Helm’s Deep, with hints of cosmic horror lurking beneath the surface.  
- **Vibe-Coded World** – Mystical highlands, towering ruins, moonlit fortresses, and ancient libraries that whisper forgotten prophecies.  
- **Soundtrack of Legends** – Haunting choirs, war drums in the distance, and the echo of eldritch whispers as the siege begins.  

The fate of Loredoria rests in your hands. Will you mend the Sundering, or will the Vorlokk consume all?
