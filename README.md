SPK was one of first people to discover the vulnerabilities of using intelloria. A rare earth mineral that's heavily used in constructing water pipes. Thanks to his discovery. He was able to help 50 billion people not die. 

(I vibe arted the pixel art)

Together, these guys are the architects for the defense of Vibydoria... But will they be able to defeat Samuel Altermon and Jeans Hung's 10 generals, the armies of NerdDiva & Skigippity toilet:


### The 10 Generals
1. Ligma man (A guy that shoots ligma)

2. Deez (A big monster made out of peanuts)

3. Discmodia (A sweaty fat demon man)

4. Steve (He's just Steve, but he can sit on the toilet without the need to scroll on his phone)

5. Andrejdor Keerpatati (One of Altermon's ai overlords, standing 5 meters tall, the mere sight of him is eldritch in nature)

6. Lixor Freðmar (He's a cyborg that can't distinguish between different women)

7. Grust Kommunita (A disgusting dark purple creature who loyally serves Altermon, from his repulsive orifices he spews out toxic gas and seeks to revise, rewrite and change any knowledge that he encounters. One his own personal goals is to get his hand on the Scrolls of Luanara so that he can rewrite it for his dark and twisted purposes)

8. Manuella Koddicka (A huge man with muscles made of pure spite. He hates Vibydoria with every core of his being and is the main architect behind the removal of the world's vibes.) 

9. Unisafor Mimoria (An odd fellow and Hung's favorite. SPK and Unisafor are sworn enemies. It is said that this was one of SPK's first experiments into sentient robotics... SPK denies this of course... Once the three guys finally meet Unisafor. The truth will come out)

10. Oney Nidexor (An evil wizard who wears a blue hat. TearJoy has tried for decades to find a way to stop him, but to no avail) 

### The NerdDiva legions

1. The Green Gremlins (These are creatures from the vector dimensions. They are really stupid but really good at floppsing. A martial arts developed by the Green Gremlins)

2. Baracudas (They are the amalgamation of fish and man, mindless slaves for the King of NerdDiva)

3. Artiexians (This mercenary legion is ruthless and merciless. Resembling orcs of time old but with much darker skin. They are great warriors however many consider them to be overpriced. And there are cheaper and even more effective mercenaries like the Amderians. The tribe of Linusia Dryverians who live in Vibydoria are the sworn enemies of the Artiexians. The war between these two factions started when Tirvaldia, the tribal leader of the Linusian Dryverians cast the Eff Yuu spell on Kudaxia the captain of the Artiexian army. Rendering him incapacitated for 200 years)


### The Unholy Armies of Altermon

1. Chattikas (Intelligent, cunning and relentless. Their skin made out of unholy metal invokes fear into the hearts of their enemies. These are the loyal servants of Altermon. With their white skin and red eyes. They resemble mutated humans. Their only known weakness being their memory, and they also sometimes hallucinate) 

2. Azurians (Recently with the Micrasoftikka accords, which essentially made Windosia a vassal state under Altermon's empire. The Azurians and their weak president Billor Gatsu are forced to fight against Vibydoria)

3. Onians (Clad in black steel armor. They are Intelligent, trained in reasoning and cunning warriors. They are one of the best of the best in Altermon's armies. They do however have a tendency to yap a lot) 

4. Teej Blamerians (Pale gremlin like creatures that don't sleep much, they are usually more active during the night. If you wake up in the morning and you get this feeling that stuff has been moved around, or seemingly normal things thrown into the trash. You might have a Teej Balmerian infestation in your house)

However, these three guys (SPK, Prymus and TearJoy) have something that Altermon and Hung doesn't have: 

The rare ore Vimomium & the magical scrolls of Luanara. 
Vimomium being better than steel, Uranium and Gold combined. It's the best material in the universe for constructing buildings and now it has been used for the construction of the: **Vimomium Towers**. 
Combining Vimomium with the Luanara scrolls and the three guys are capable of enchanting the Vimomium towers with magical inscriptions, these inscriptions are what allows the Vimomium towers and buildings to shoot magical projectiles against the forces of darkness. 


## The different lands & Their lore ⛰️


### Vibydoria 🌴
The lush lands of Vibydoria is nothing without their people. Here people are reasonable and don't hop on new trends constantly. The people who live here enjoy greenery, productive use of their time in the form of actually manually doing work by hand instead of letting others do the work for them. 
For vacation spots the people here reccomend going to the north of Vibydoria where Kalfornaya is located, with lots of beaches and good weather Kalfornaya is a go to spot of rest and relaxation.

### Mordoria 🌋
Mordoria is a dark and desolate place, here there are absolutely no vibes. Here the people are grey and dull  and can't think for themselves. The main way of transportation are bandwagons, but the bandwagons rarely lead to good places. 
The people here worship whom they call the The Messiah, a being thought of to be made of metal and unholy flesh in temples located in the Mordoria mountains. And The promised Messiah is the reason Altermon is conquering the world. Since Samuel Altermon wants to pave the way for The Messiah. He's been saying for the last two years that The Messiah will come and when he does. No one will have to work anymore and everyone would be fired from their jobs because of it. But nothing has happened. And people still have to work. 

### NerdDiva 🌳
Kind of mid, resembles Ohio a lot. Everything is super expensive here

### Lands of Skibidor 🚽 

Skibidor is the main seat for the Skigippity Toilet empire, and the capital Dobdijes is located here. Everyone here is under the iron fist of Altermon. And it shows, almost every square inch of Skibidor is for the sole purpose of making room for metal buildings, structures and idolatrous erections dedicated to sole purpose of trying to summon The Messiah. Because of this Skibidor is gray and lifeless and the living areas dedicated for housing its inhabitants is kept to a minimum, so as to make sure that no more than the absolute basic needs occupy space that should be dedicated to summoning their Messiah


## The Luanara scrolls 📜 & Luanara cards
Some say the Luanara scrolls are older than time itself, others say that the scrolls are a creation from a bygone era where Wizards, sorcerers and shamans had access to more divine knowledge. 
It is also said that the Luanara scrolls that are being kept in the catacombs of Vybidoria are not the only Luanara scrolls.. But that there might be more like them... 

However the knowledgeable TearJoy has found another use for the scrolls: The creation of **Luanara cards**. Using the scrolls the three guys are able to inscribe divine magical properties to these cards. The cards are then able to enchant the vimomium towers with abilities...

Once construction of a Vimomium tower is complete there are several inscriptions that you can enscribe into it. 


(I added the part below when Adam started to appear on the screen and showing us his pixel art, in case he wanted inspiration) 

1. Dawn of Fire: From the scrolls on page 669 this card gives the Vimomium tower the ability to shoot out projectiles of fire, searing through flesh and causing burn

2. Spear of Luanara: Found on page 56 in the scrolls, once this card is enscribed unto a tower the tower starts shooting arrows at the enemy

3. Winds of Cold: Found on page 700 in the scrolls, enscribe this card unto a tower and the tower will shoot cold piercing winds that slows enemies down, causing them great damage due to hypothermia 

4. Toxic balls: Found on page 42 in the scrolls.. When someone creates a card from this inscription.. This card becomes one of the more horrid inscriptions.. Once the card has enchanted a tower. The tower will start shooting green toxic balls that poison enemies over time

5. Divine strikes: The enscription for this is found on the very last page of the Luanara scrolls.. Some say this is a gift from God himself. Once this card is enscribed unto a tower, the tower will smite enemies with lightning strikes that causes extra damage to unholy enemies

6. Stones blast: This inscription is found on the elemental pages of the Luanara scrolls. Once this card is enscribed unto a tower the tower will rain down stones in an AOE, essentially shooting rocks from all directions from the center of the tower. Due to the magical nature of these stones, they can sometimes randomly stick unto enemies. 

7. Watery water: This inscription is found on chapter 70 regarding water divination. Once this enscribed unto a tower it will shoot high jet streams of water upon its enemies. If the enemy is freezing will cause EXTREME cold shock. Causing the enemy extra damage. 

8. Holy oil: This inscription is from the chapter regarding holy rites in the Luanara scrolls. When a card with this inscription is embedded unto a tower the tower throws crystal vials of holy oil unto the enemy dealing minmal damage. If a an enemy has been shot by a Dawn Of Fire tower and burn is applied. The burn increases in damage and also increases the duration of burn on an enemy

9. Sun beam: Found on page 233, when a card with this inscription is enscribed unto a tower. The tower shoots out a rectangular beam of the holiest of ultraviolet rays. If an enemy who has the toxic balls affliction gets hit by a sun beam. The sun beams will act as a catalyst for the toxicity that an enemy experience and cause more damage to said enemy. 

10. Thermitium explosion: Found in the chapter of fire in the scrolls. Once a card that has this inscription and is enchanted into a card. And then inscribed into a vimomium tower. The tower will send bombs that detonate on impact. If a thermitium explosion lands on an enemy with the Stones Blasts stone affliction. The stone will start an incendiary reaction, cashing a short burn over time on the enemy.  

### Scrolls of Enhancement 🧪
TearJoy wasn't the only one who was doing experiments with the scrolls and Vimomium ore. Many times after sieges you could see either SPK or Prymus working in the underground laboratories that were located near the siege lines. But on one particular day... SPK would discover something extraordinary.. Something that could turn the tide in the war against Skigippity Toilet and NerdDiva... 

One day while SPK was down in the lab. He was holding a card for some experiments that he was doing. He was holding an unenchanted empty card. The card accidentally slipped out his hand and landed unto one of the pages of the Luanara scrolls that TearJoy hade previously ripped out for research purposes. 

SPK thinking to himself: *TearJoy couldn't even bother to pick up one of our most important weapons against the emperor and the king from the floor*, 
when he was about to pick it up. He accidentally bumped his head unto the table. This caused a vial containing **Essence of The Viewer** to spill out its content unto the page. SPK couldn't believe his eyes: The scroll started to glow with an intense radiating white light. And what couldn't have been more than a split second the card started to fly up in the air in making a whistling sound as it flew across the room. SPK being a little skittish hid under the table. After things had calmed down. He saw the card laying on the ground... The card was still radiating with that white light. Musting up a little courage. He walked up to the card to pick it up. It was still warm. But the inscriptions on this card was different from the other cards he and the guys would usually make to enchant the vimomium towers. 
He couldn't understand what the inscriptions were saying. So he went to TearJoy who was sitting on a rock outside the lab, he hadn't heard the commotion in the lab. Most likely he was to preoccupied with thinking about the Luanara scrolls. 
SPK approached him: *Could you read this card for me?*

TearJoy simply grunted and took the card from SPK's hands: *Well, the card clearly reads Sigma Fire* 

TearJoy asked him: *How did you create this card?* 

SPK to embarrassed to admit what had actually transpired in the lab simply said: *I was experimenting with inscribing the scrolls unto some of the empty cards, and was testing out different ways the card might react to chemical reactions. So I poured some Essence of the Viewer on to one of the scroll pages that was laying on the floor and then I put the card unto the page*

TearJoy simply scoffed: *You're lucky you didn't die in an explosion, this was clearly a Dawn of Fire page you put that card on, however. You might have discovered something new. There has to be connection between this card and a Dawn of Fire tower.*

So they went the two of them too a tower with the Dawn of Fire inscription. TearJoy with the card still in his hand decided to put the card unto the tower and inscribe it. To their surprise the vimomium tower started to change in color and looks. What had previously been just one fire ball rotating around the tower. Were now several fire balls. 

TearJoy was astonished: *Marvelous, SPK, get Prymus he needs to see this* 

And so they discovered the cards of enhancement. Cards that couldn't necessarily inscribe a Vimomium tower with **new** magical properties but could now enhance and upgrade a tower that **already** had magical properties inscribed to it. Given the card belonged to the same elemental type as the vimomium tower that had that specific magical type. 

>One thing that I suggested before Low Level went to bed is to place the tower first and then place a specific card unto that tower (Ergo, you have a "default tower card"). However, even though this might be feasible. It could potentially slow down the game flow, as this would require extra steps for the player to take in order for them to start placing towers and start killing enemies. However, this could open up potential for changing.. You could call it the **elemental type** of a specific tower. Let's say you inscribe "Toxic balls" onto a tower. You might want to inscribe Dawn of Fire if the next waves of enemies are weaker to fire or something. 
Hence, one suggestion would be to have a "default state". (I don't know Lua so I will just throw out some words here). Let's say the "tower object" contains a reference to an array of empty values. A specific Luanara card would in this case assign a value to this empty reference, if a tower is in its default state (default = empty reference) it will be given a new value. This would also allow for a tower to switch types dynamically if it already has been assigned a card. Or: Upgrade it if you assign the same card again to a tower that already has been assigned that specific card. A Dawn of Fire tower would in this case just be upgraded if you would assign the Dawn of Fire card **again** to it. I don't know if this made sense. I'm also a bit tired lol. 

## Vimomium ore & its origins 
Vimomium was discovered in Vybidoria just right after the cataclysm of  Jiripity on the 30 of November 2022. Its said that Jiripity was on a richer scale 3.5. The day all hell broke lose and Altermon decided that he would try and summon The Messiah (We are still like 40 years before The Messiah comes). It was during this time the council of Nova Vomium was formed and TearJoy spearheaded this council to make sure that Vimomium was was used to its fullest potential. Some might say that this discovery came just in time... Like a gift from above... One startling discovery regarding Vimomium was the fact that its replenishable.. If dead biological material is placed on it. It's as if Vimomium ore consumes biomatter like a living entity. Thanks to this discovery, the three guys swiftly realized if they took the dead bodies of fallen enemies. They could almost in an instant have more Vimomium ore for the construction of new towers

>Essentially what I'm trying to get here is that each enemy killed replenishes your "Vimomium ore bank" I just needed to add a lore reason as to how the player is able to get Vimomium ore. We use this instead of mana. One suggestion could be a "sun flower" mechanic from Plants Vs Zombies. Where you have a specific tower in this case that is responsible for generating the ore you need to buy and place tower cards on the map. Where you have a Vimomium deposit and once an enemy is killed you can simply pick that enemy up and put them into the vimomium ore deposit. However, then you guys would probably have to write drag and drop mechanics for the enemies as well. Which.. In hindsight seems like more technical debt. You could try and vibe this part I guess

Btw guys, would be hilarious if you guys could use these different noises as like death sounds or something:
