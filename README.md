## 🎵 Tower of Vibes: The War for Loredoria 🎵
“In the beginning, there was only sound. Then... came the static.”

🧙‍♂️ The Myth of the Worldsong
In the earliest days of Loredoria, the land was held together not by steel or sorcery, but by the Worldsong — a divine symphony echoing through mountains, rivers, and souls. It was maintained by the Vibekeepers, ancient guardians who built towering obelisks known as the Harmonics, each attuned to a different elemental frequency: Bass, Treble, Echo, and Silence.

When all Harmonics resonated in harmony, peace reigned. Birds vibed. Trees danced. The grass wrote strongly-typed poetry in TypeScript.

But all songs end.

😈 The Dissonance Awakens
From the forgotten depths of the Codevoid — a dimension where cursed syntax and broken bindings roam — came Maelruhn the Dissonant, a former Vibekeeper turned corrupted by a forbidden chord: the Null Chord. Rumor says Maelruhn once tried to optimize the Worldsong by rewriting it… in Vim.

“It’s just faster,” he said.
— Primeagen, 1st Age of Cope

Driven mad by his obsession with keybindings and purity, Maelruhn formed the Bug Horde, an army of malformed snippets: Nullcasters, Segfaulters, Runtime Wraiths, and the dreaded Merge Conflict Beasts. Each step they take silences the land, crashing towers with a 500 error.

🏰 The Towers Must Vibe
You are the last Vibekeeper, sworn to defend the Harmonics. Each tower channels a different element of the lost Worldsong:

Bass Bastion – Unleashes shockwaves that literally drop the beat.

Treble Spire – Shreds through enemies with piercing falsetto lasers.

Echo Watchtower – Reflects and amplifies past attacks like a stack trace in real time.

The Pause Pillar – Freezes time, forces cooldowns, and forces enemies to touch grass.

Your goal: restore the towers, vibe-check the horde, and resync the Worldsong.

🧠 The Legend of Primeagen, First of His Keybind
In the days before the Fall, a chaotic-neutral monk known as The Primeagen foretold the war.
He spoke in riddles and streamed in Vim. His teachings were misunderstood, often confused with trolling. But one phrase remains etched in every tower:

“If it has mouse support, it’s already fallen.”
— Primeagen, last known words before ragequitting the Council

Some say he still roams the Dissonant Wastes, rebinding keys, resisting IDEs, and yelling about performance gains no one understands.
