# Arrow Tower

The stout longbow, invented by the **Grey Hunters** of the trackless Lordorian wilds, when they lived. It is now used for hunting, of a different nature.

# Scope

A peculiar device, which enahances precision, but slows aiming. Crafted by the scholars of **Vibromancy**, remote in their opalescent towers, and donated to the **Ardent Wardens**.  

# Crossbow

Crafted of ply whalebone on the Shores of Crystal, by the off-whale-roaders, only the mightiest can wind this monsterous weapon.
